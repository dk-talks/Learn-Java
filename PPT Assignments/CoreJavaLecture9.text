        Integration with Other Technologies: Spring seamlessly integrates with popular frameworks and technologies such as Hibernate, JPA, JMS, Quartz, and more, providing a unified platform for 
        application development.
        
        Testing Support: Spring offers comprehensive support for unit and integration testing, allowing developers to write test cases for their code easily.
