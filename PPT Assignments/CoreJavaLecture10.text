Q1. What is the Spring MVC framework?
A1. The Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework is a popular Java-based web framework that follows the MVC architectural pattern. It provides a structured way to build web applications 
    by separating the application logic into three components: the model (data), the view (presentation), and the controller (handling requests and managing flow).



Q2. What are the benefits of the Spring MVC framework over other MVC frameworks?
A2. The Spring MVC framework offers several benefits compared to other MVC frameworks:
  Lightweight: The framework is lightweight and does not impose any specific architectural constraints, allowing flexibility in designing applications.
  Inversion of Control (IoC): Spring's IoC container enables loose coupling, dependency injection, and easier unit testing.
  Integration with other Spring modules: It seamlessly integrates with other Spring modules such as Spring Security, Spring Data, and Spring Boot.
  Extensibility: The framework provides various extension points and allows easy integration of third-party libraries.
  Robustness: Spring MVC offers robust error handling, validation, and data binding capabilities.
  Testability: It promotes test-driven development (TDD) by supporting easy unit testing of controllers and other components.



Q3. What is the DispatcherServlet in Spring MVC? In other words, can you explain the Spring MVC architecture?
A3. The DispatcherServlet is a central component of the Spring MVC framework. It acts as the front controller that receives all incoming requests and dispatches them to appropriate handlers 
    (controllers) based on the request URL or other criteria. The Spring MVC architecture can be explained as follows:

    Client sends a request: A client (usually a web browser) sends an HTTP request to the application.
    
    DispatcherServlet receives the request: The DispatcherServlet intercepts the request and becomes the entry point for the request processing.
    
    HandlerMapping resolves the request: The DispatcherServlet consults the configured HandlerMapping to determine the appropriate handler (controller) for the request.
    
    Handler (Controller) processes the request: The selected handler (controller) processes the request by executing business logic, accessing models, and preparing a response.
    
    HandlerAdapter invokes the handler: The HandlerAdapter invokes the selected handler and provides necessary data to process the request.
    
    Handler returns a ModelAndView: The handler returns a ModelAndView object that encapsulates the model (data) and the logical view name.
    
    ViewResolver resolves the view: The DispatcherServlet consults the configured ViewResolver to determine the actual View implementation for the logical view name.
    
    View renders the response: The selected View renders the model data and produces the response (HTML, JSON, XML, etc.) to be sent back to the client.
    
    DispatcherServlet returns the response: The DispatcherServlet sends the response back to the client for display or further processing.



Q4. What is a View Resolver pattern, and explain its significance in Spring MVC?
A4. The View Resolver pattern is a design pattern used in Spring MVC to resolve the logical view name returned by a controller into an actual View implementation. The significance of a
    View Resolver in Spring MVC is as follows:

    Decoupling of logical view names: Controllers in Spring MVC return logical view names instead of specifying a concrete view. The View Resolver maps these logical names to actual views, allowing the flexibility to change the view technology or presentation layer without modifying the controllers.
    
    Dynamic view resolution: View Resolvers can dynamically determine the appropriate view implementation based on factors such as the user's device, locale, or other application-specific criteria.
    
    View customization: View Resolvers can apply pre-processing or post-processing logic to the resolved view, allowing customization of the rendering process.

Q5. What are the differences between @RequestParam and @PathVariable annotations?
A5. The differences between @RequestParam and @PathVariable annotations in Spring MVC are as follows:

    @RequestParam: It is used to extract query parameters or form data from the request URL. The parameters are typically specified as part of the URL query string (e.g., ?param1=value1&param2=value2). It is optional unless explicitly specified, and the parameter values are bound to method parameters.
    
    @PathVariable: It is used to extract dynamic values from the request URL path. The values are specified as placeholders within the URL path itself (e.g., /users/{id}). It is required, and the parameter values are bound to method parameters.
    
    In summary, @RequestParam extracts parameters from the request URL query string, while @PathVariable extracts values from the URL path.
