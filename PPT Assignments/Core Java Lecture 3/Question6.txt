Data Protection: Encapsulation protects the internal state of an object by hiding its implementation details. This prevents direct access or modification of data by external code, ensuring data
integrity and security.

Code Flexibility: Encapsulation provides a clear separation between the public interface of a class and its internal implementation. This allows for modifications to the internal implementation 
without affecting other parts of the code that rely on the class. It promotes code flexibility and easier maintenance.

Code Reusability: Encapsulation allows for creating reusable components by defining well-defined interfaces and hiding the underlying implementation details. This enables the reuse of 
encapsulated objects in different parts of the code or in other projects, promoting code modularity and efficiency.

Enhanced Debugging and Testing: Encapsulation makes it easier to debug and test code. The encapsulated nature of objects allows for focused testing and debugging of specific components,
leading to more efficient bug identification and resolution.

Information Hiding: Encapsulation hides the complexity of implementation details, exposing only the necessary information through well-defined interfaces. This helps in reducing code 
dependencies and managing complexity, improving code readability and maintainability.
