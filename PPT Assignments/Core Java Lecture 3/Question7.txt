No, Java is not considered a 100% Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language. While Java is primarily designed to support OOP principles, there are a few aspects that deviate from pure OOP. 
Here are a few reasons why Java is not considered a 100% OOP language:

  1. Primitive Data Types: Java includes primitive data types like int, boolean, float, etc., which are not objects. Unlike objects, primitive types are not instances of classes and do not have 
    associated methods or behaviors.
  
  2. Static Members: Java allows the declaration of static variables and methods that are associated with a class rather than an instance. Static members can be accessed without creating an object,
    which goes against the principles of pure OOP, where everything should be an instance of a class.
  
  3. Procedural Programming Features: Java supports procedural programming features like control structures (if, for, while), which are not strictly part of the OOP paradigm. These features allow 
    developers to write code that follows procedural programming principles alongside OOP concepts.
  
  4. Inheritance Limitations: Java supports single inheritance, where a class can inherit from only one superclass. Pure OOP languages, on the other hand, support multiple inheritance, allowing 
    a class to inherit from multiple superclasses. Java introduces interfaces as a mechanism to achieve a form of multiple inheritance through interface implementation.
  
  5. Direct Memory Manipulation: Java provides a mechanism for direct memory manipulation through the use of pointers (java.nio.Buffer), which allows access to memory addresses and introduces 
    an element of low-level programming. This aspect is not strictly aligned with the encapsulation principle of OOP.
  
  6. Despite these deviations, Java is widely recognized as an object-oriented programming language due to its strong support for encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and other OOP concepts. 
    It encourages the use of objects, classes, and abstraction, and provides extensive libraries and tools for building large-scale, object-oriented applications.
