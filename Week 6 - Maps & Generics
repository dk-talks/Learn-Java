                Maps & Generics assignment
                
1. What is a Map in Java?
Ans 1 - A Map in Java is an interface which represents a collection of Key and Value Pair. This collection of a key and value pair is called an Entry.
        Keys in maps are unique, they cannot be duplicate and both keys and values are of type Object.
        
2. What are the commonly used implementation of Map in Java?
Ans - There are majorly four implementation of Map.
        1. HashMap - HashMap stores key-value pair of object and here order of insertion is not guaranteed because behind the seen it uses hashing algorithm
           to store data. Values can be duplicate here.
        2. HashTable - It is almost similar to HashMap but in hashTable Null values are not allowed and it is thread safe.
        3. TreeMap - It also stores the data in key-value pairs and data is sorted based on the keys in treeMap.
        4. LinkedHashMap - Similar to hashMap but data's order is maintained here because it stores data in form of nodes and info is stored there to order them.
        
3. What are the difference between HashMap & TreeMap?
Ans - HashMap - hashmap is an implementation of Map interface. Order of data is not  gauranteed here, because of less processing in it operations like addition,
              deletion, updation takes place faster. works on hashing algorithm.
      TreeMap - TreeMap is also an implementation of map interface. Order of data is maintained in sorted order based on the keys. behind the seen it uses Binary
      sarch tree to sort the data. Because of high processing of data in sorting, it takes little bit more time to perform operations than HashMap.
   
4. How do you check if a key exist in a Map in Java?
Ans - To check if a key exists in a Map, first we have to iterate through the map by converting the map either into entrySet or keySet.
      while fetching data we can downcast the iterator.next() statement to our desired object and check it usinng if else.
      example -
        HashMap hm = new HashMap();
        hm.put(1, "Dinesh");
        hm.put(2, "Devendra");
        
        Set s1 = hm.keySet();
        Iterator it = s1.iterator();
        
        while(it.hasNext()) {
           if( (Integer)it.next() == 1) {
              // if at any point key is 1, this block will be executed...
              System.out.println("Yes key exists);
           }
        }
